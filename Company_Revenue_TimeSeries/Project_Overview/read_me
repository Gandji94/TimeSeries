In the following case study, I want to predict a company's revenue measured by sales quantity, average costs and average annual number of employees.

I will use different TimeSeries models to predict the correct revenue passed on a monthly frequency.

Models that were used in the project:

- AutoRegression

- Holt-Winters

    -- SimpleSmoothing
    
    -- ExponentialSmoothing

- TBATS

- SARIMA
